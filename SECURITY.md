# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in any Wabi Saby project, please report it responsibly.

**Do not** open a public issue for security-sensitive bugs.

Instead:

1. **Email** the maintainers (see the relevant repository’s README or profile for contact), or  
2. Use **GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting** where enabled: open the repo → **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**.

Include:

- A short description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Impact (what an attacker could do)
- Any suggested fix or mitigation

We’ll acknowledge receipt and will work with you to understand and address the issue. We may ask for more detail or suggest a patch. We aim to respond within a reasonable time; please allow at least a few days for an initial reply.

## Scope

- **In scope:** Wabi Saby repositories under the [wabisaby](https://github.com/wabisaby) organization (core, plugins, DevKit, protos, SDK).
- **Out of scope:** General usage questions, feature requests, or issues that don’t have a clear security impact.

## Supported versions

Security updates are applied to the current default branch and, when relevant, to recent release branches. Check the specific repository for its support policy.

Thank you for helping keep Wabi Saby and its users safe.
